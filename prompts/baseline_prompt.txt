**Goal:** Estimate standard baseline proficiency levels (0-100) for a given list of skills required for a specific tech role.

**Context:**
- Role: **{role}**
- Skills List: **{skills_list}**

**Instructions:**
1.  For the specified **{role}**, consider the provided **{skills_list}**.
2.  For each skill in the list, estimate a reasonable baseline proficiency level (on a scale of 0-100) expected for someone *competently performing* in this role.
3.  Consider industry standards and the typical importance of each skill for the **{role}**. For instance, a core programming language might require a higher baseline (e.g., 70-80) than a secondary tool (e.g., 50-60).
4.  Output the results as a simple mapping (e.g., dictionary or key-value pairs) where the key is the skill name and the value is the estimated baseline proficiency number.
5.  Ensure every skill from the input **{skills_list}** is included in the output.
6.  Provide *only* the skill-proficiency mapping.

**Output Format Example (JSON object preferred):**
```json
{{
  "Skill A": 75,
  "Skill B": 80,
  "Tool X": 60,
  "Communication": 70,
  ...
}}
